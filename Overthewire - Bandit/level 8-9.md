```

the only line of text that occurs only once. It mean only one non-repeating containt pasword

At this level I will use 

- sort  : sort lines in alphabetical order default is ascending
- uniq -u  :  print only lines that appear exactly one. 
- and pipe to filter out unique line

## cat filename | sort | uniq -u

must be in order `sort` and next is `uniq -u`. if reverse it, the lines are duplicated and not adjacent â†’ uniq will not detect

# Note

`uniq` (including uniq -u) only work on consecutive duplicate lines
